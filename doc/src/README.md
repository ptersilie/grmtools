# grmtools

grmtools is a suite of Rust libraries and binaries for parsing text, both at
compile-time, and run-time. Most users will probably be interested in the
compile-time Yacc feature, which allows traditional `.y` files to be used mostly
unchanged in Rust. See the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) for a quick
introduction to this feature.
